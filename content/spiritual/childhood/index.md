I grew up thinking my life wasn’t mine—until I took it back.  
Promise
I’m no expert—just a 27-year-old who survived a chaotic childhood, built a $200k crypto nest egg, and learned to love myself. If you’re trapped by fear or others’ expectations, I’ve been there. This is how I escaped—and how you can too.  


I grew up learning that to put others before myself. That my thoughts and my desires didn’t matter. That my existence was only valuable if I pleased others. This is how I escaped from passivity. I’m no expert—just a 27-year-old, and I want to help escape a life of passivity.

# My Journey
I didn’t always know who I was meant to be. Growing up in a household where my every action was scrutinized, I became trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, fear, and shyness. My childhood conditioned me to believe that mistakes weren’t lessons—they were failures. That love wasn’t unconditional—it was earned. And that my needs came second to the needs of others.

This is how I became that way. And more importantly, this is how I started to break free.

Childhood (My Perspective)
My mom was the definition of a tiger mom—strict, emotionally unpredictable, and controlling. My dad was present physically but absent emotionally. I could probably count on one hand the number of meaningful conversations I had with him from childhood through high school.

I had my twin brother, and we both coped by escaping into video games. That was our safe space. We weren’t allowed to play often, but when we did, it was the only time I felt truly free.

Most of my formative experiences—the ones that shaped my mindset—happened before high school.

#### My Mother: The Root of My Fear
From a young age, I learned to fear my mom because I never knew who she would be that day. One moment, she was a caring mother. The next, she was in a rage, taunting us with suicide threats. Other times, she would suddenly act weak, claiming an injury that became a lifelong "illness"—an unspoken burden that made me feel responsible for her well-being.

I was never allowed to have my own emotions because hers took priority.

I learned to bury my thoughts, my feelings, my desires—because speaking up was dangerous.

I was taught that my worth was tied to obedience, that my job was to ease her anxiety, to be perfect, to never make mistakes—but I wasn’t perfect. And no child should have to be.

I realized at 27 that her worry was her problem. That she had to deal with her own insecurities. But as a child, I didn’t know that. All I knew was that my role in life was to make her happy, or at the very least, not make her upset.

#### The Conditioning: How I Became Passive
Punishment & Control
As a kid, I wasn’t just expected to do well—I was expected to be perfect.

If I cried during punishment, she hit me harder—as if my emotions were a crime.
If I cleaned the house, she would rage at my incompetence—as if mistakes were proof I was worthless.
If I didn’t eat certain foods, she forced me to eat them for my "health"—as if my personal preferences didn’t matter.
I was conditioned to believe my desires were irrelevant.

Even when she hit me, she would later say:
"Come here, let’s hug. You know I love you, right?"

The Moments That Defined My Fear
Suicide threats: My mom would grab a knife, hold it to herself, and threaten to kill herself in front of me.
Reckless driving: In her rage, she would speed up to 90-100 mph, yelling, "Let’s all die together."
I remember sitting in the car, paralyzed with fear, knowing I had no control.


At home, in the kitchen, there was another kind of terror. More than once, when truly angered beyond control, my mom would grab a knife and threaten to kill herself. I can still recall the haunting image: her lips twisted in a grimace, eyes wide with desperation, the knife held high at an angle toward her stomach. She’d wave it down at the last moment, never fully committing to the act. I was frozen—emotionless. I didn’t scream or beg her to stop. Instead, I just stared, numb and detached, wondering silently, "What am I supposed to feel? Why don’t I feel anything?" This was a stark, separate experience from the reckless driving threats; it was raw, up-close, and left a permanent mark on my understanding of love and fear. 

I also remember the numbness. The emotional detachment. The feeling of just… staring at it all, wondering: Why don’t I feel anything?

That learned helplessness followed me into adulthood.
I grew up confused about what love even meant. Was it just to care about others?

#### Neglecting My Needs
In fourth or fifth grade, I got a wart on my head and another on my lip. I told my mom, but she dismissed it. I had to go to school feeling disgusting for months, hoping no one would notice. It wasn’t until a trip to China that my uncle finally took me to get it removed.

In sixth grade, I came down with the flu. I remember my mom mentioning it might be the new swine flu of 2009 and telling me I needed to isolate myself. I thought, "It would be wrong of me to risk getting anyone else sick. I need to be a good person and stay away." At the time, thoughts of death did cross my mind, but I never told anyone. I simply accepted that some things were out of my control and hoped for the best—even though I was a little afraid I might die. With no one to talk to, I kept it all within me.

But looking back, I wasn’t just physically sick. I was mentally conditioned to suppress my own suffering. I didn’t believe my pain was worth acknowledging, and my self-esteem continued to lower.

#### Internalized Shame
Throughout childhood, my mom made comments about my appearance.
"Why are your eyes uneven?"
"Your lips are too big. Curl them to make them smaller."
I believed I was ugly, that I had to hide my face, avoid eye contact, shrink myself.

She constantly compared me to others, always reminding me of kids who achieved more, did more, were more.
I had no goals because I was terrified of failure. I avoided competition, I avoided risk, I avoided living.
In elementary and middle school, I had friends, but I was always seeking approval. By high school, I moved to a new state without my mom, and I learned to isolate myself.

#### The Long-Term Impact
I grew up believing I wasn’t enough.
I was afraid of making mistakes because mistakes meant punishment.
I was afraid of relationships because love, to me, was obligation and sacrifice.
I was afraid to pursue anything I wanted because I had spent my life focused on what others wanted from me.
I have never kissed a girl at 27 years old. Not because I couldn’t, but because I ran from relationships the way I wanted to be away from my mother, but also felt obligated to be with her. I felt unlovable.

I lived inside my own head, escaping into video games, books, and movies. I did just enough to get good grades, enough to seem "successful" on paper. But I wasn’t living.
This is already **powerful, raw, and deeply insightful**, but I see areas where it can be improved for **clarity, structure, and impact**. Here’s a refined version that strengthens your message, enhances flow, and makes it easier to read while keeping your voice intact.

# **The Grind: Chasing Freedom Through Hard Work**  

From a young age, I pinned all my problems to **one solution—money.**  

- If I had money, I wouldn’t have to care about anything.  
- If I had money, I could provide for myself.  
- If I had money, I would have **freedom.**  

I thought money would **fix everything.** I saw how my family struggled, how their worries consumed them. If we had more money, wouldn’t everything just work out?  

Even though I had no money, **investing always fascinated me.** But instead of investing in myself—my skills, my mindset—I just **saved as much as possible** and put my money into safe, low-risk stock market options. I quickly realized that traditional investing would take **far too long** to make any real money, but I also felt **trapped.** Even with a college degree, I **didn’t believe I could land a good job.**  

Then, an opportunity came.  

### **The Restaurant: The Sacrifice for Financial Freedom**  
My cousin approached me with an idea: **open a bubble tea store together.** I didn’t care about the business itself—I cared about **the money.** If this worked, I could use it as a stepping stone for **real financial freedom.**  

So I did it.  

From **January 2021 to December 2024**, I worked **70-90 hours a week.** No real life. No free time. Just **work.**  

But in those years, something changed. I started to **see my own potential.**  

- I realized I was **capable.**  
- I learned to **find creative solutions quickly.**  
- I developed **confidence in my ability to adapt and problem-solve.**  

As I gained a little more control over my schedule (dropping down to 60-70 hours a week), I decided to **use that extra time for myself.** But instead of learning something useful, I made a strange decision:  

I decided to get **really good at Valorant.**  

---

### **Valorant & The Confidence Shift**  
For **three months**, I practiced religiously. **A little before bed, ranked games when I had time.**  

Then, I hit **Immortal 3**—one of the top ranks in the game.  

And then I quit.  

This might sound meaningless to some, but to me, **it changed everything.**  

For the first time, I realized: **I could develop skills.**  
- I wasn’t "just smart." I could **discipline myself.**  
- I could **compete and win.**  
- I wasn’t some guy who just “got by” on natural ability. **I could build ability.**  

That confidence **carried over.** I knew I didn’t want to work in the restaurant industry forever. The work-life balance was **terrible.** So, I tried **learning how to program.**  

---

### **Programming & The First Big Career Shift**  
I spent **months learning to code**—and I actually liked it. Building things, solving problems—it was satisfying.  

But then reality hit.  

- **The job market was oversaturated.**  
- **I lost interest.**  

I didn’t love programming itself. I **loved solving problems.** But I didn’t want to sit behind a screen all day writing code for a company that could replace me in a second.  

So I dropped it.  

Instead, I turned inward.  

---

### **The Physical Transformation: Becoming the Strongest Version of Myself**  
I looked at myself and realized: **I was getting older. I was getting fatter. I hated it.**  

It reminded me of something: **As a kid, I always wanted to be as strong and athletic as possible.** I was naturally athletic, but I **never pushed myself.** I always held back.  

So I decided to **change that.**  

The first week, I hit the gym hard. But I quickly realized—I had no idea what I was doing. **I needed a plan.**  

I signed up for **THP Training** and started **explosive athletic training in May 2024.**  

This was **different** from anything I had done before.  

- **I couldn’t hide behind a computer screen.**  
- **I had to put myself out there.**  
- **I had to be physically vulnerable in front of others.**  

Through this, I started learning something I had never been taught:  
**I mattered. My wants mattered. My goals mattered.**  

---

## **Self-Love: The Realization That Changed Everything**  

What is **self-love?** What is **selfish desire?**  

I used to think **putting myself first was wrong.** But then I realized something critical:  

> **Self-love means my wants, needs, and feelings are my responsibility.**  
> **Other people’s wants, needs, and feelings are their responsibility.**  

That doesn’t mean I ignore others. It means:  
- **If someone has a need, they must voice it.**  
- **If I have a need, I must voice it.**  
- **If our needs align, we compromise. If not, we move forward.**  

It means **I am not responsible for fixing someone else’s emotions.**  

> **If someone worries that my dreams will leave me broke, that is their worry.**  
> I can listen, I can evaluate risk—but their worry is theirs to deal with.  

This shift **freed me** from the invisible chains I had lived under for years.  

- **I no longer needed to be “perfect” to make others comfortable.**  
- **I no longer had to prove my worth through self-sacrifice.**  
- **I could simply live.**  

---

## **Emotional Control & True Peace**  

Self-love is only part of the equation. The next step is **learning to stay calm and centered.**  

> **Emotions are not the enemy. They are tools.**  

- **Anger teaches you what you’ve been neglecting.**  
- **Joy teaches you where to go next.**  
- **Sadness brings lessons you haven’t fully learned.**  

But emotions should **guide you, not control you.**  

I started meditating, **training my mind** to:  
- Recognize emotions without being consumed by them.  
- Stay present, instead of worrying about the past or future.  
- Use emotions **strategically** rather than react impulsively.  

When you believe you control your destiny, the world **moves in your favor.**  

---

## **Ready for Love: The Final Step**  

Understanding **self-love** is **essential before entering a relationship.**  

- Without self-awareness, you **lose yourself in love.**  
- Without self-respect, you **sacrifice your needs to please your partner.**  
- Without emotional control, you **react instead of leading.**  

Now, for the first time, I **feel ready.**  

Not because I’m perfect. But because I **know what I’m responsible for.**  

- **I am responsible for my own wants, needs, and emotions.**  
- **My partner is responsible for hers.**  
- **Together, we meet in the middle—not out of obligation, but out of genuine love.**  

True self-love **expands outward.** When I am whole within myself, I can love someone else **without conditions, without fear, without attachment.**  

This is my path forward.
